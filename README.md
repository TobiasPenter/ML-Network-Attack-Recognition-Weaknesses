# ML-Network-Attack-Recognition-Weaknesses

## About
This repository holds the code for my dissertation project, "Investigating the Accuracy of Machine Learning in Network Attack Detection". Withing the repository is the code for the three experiments as well as a majority of the models and the charts created as a result of the experiments. To use this code, the datasets must be downloaded and put into the relvant folders within the repository. Further details can be found in the writen report that will be available online at a later date.
